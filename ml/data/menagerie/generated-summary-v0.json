[{"assignment_number": 624, "participant_id": 24, "response": "Grades:\nCode Elegance: 6\nCorrectness: 5\nDocumentation: 6\nReadability: 7\n\nFeedback:\nCode Elegance:\nThe code is functional but lacks conciseness and creativity. It often doesn't extend beyond base classes and has redundancy. Refactoring is needed to reduce loops and eliminate magic numbers. However, some parts are well-structured and use good OOP principles.\n\nCorrectness:\nThe code frequently fails to meet assignment requirements, such as simulating different species and handling time of day. Logical issues like incorrect flags and syntax errors are present, impacting overall correctness.\n\nDocumentation:\nDocumentation exists but is often too generic and lacks depth, especially for complex logic. Inline comments are sparse, making it harder to understand certain sections without reading the entire code.\n\nReadability:\nThe code is generally readable with clear structure and variable names. However, some methods are too long and could be split for better readability. The use of magic numbers slightly hinders clarity."}]
