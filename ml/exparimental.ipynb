At least two of\\nthese should be predators (they eat another species), and at least two of them should not be\\npredators (they may eat plants). You can either treat plants as if they’re always available\\nor simulate their growth/death (see challenge task).\\n• At least two predators should compete for the same food source.\\n• Some or all of the species should distinguish male and female individuals. For these, the\\ncreatures can only propagate when a male and female individual meet. Meet means they\\nneed to be within a speciﬁed distance to each other, for example in a neighbouring cell.\\nYou will need to experiment with the parameters for breeding probability to create a stable\\npopulation.\\n• You should keep track of the time of day. At least some creatures should exhibit diﬀerent\\nbehaviour at some time of the day (for example: they may sleep at night and not move\\naround during that time).\\nYou should implement the base tasks ﬁrst before you move on to the Challenge tasks.\\n4 Challenge Tasks\\nOnce you have ﬁnished the base tasks, implement one or more challenge tasks. You can either\\nchoose from the following suggestions, or invent your own. You will be graded on a maximum of\\nfour challenge tasks.\\n• Simulate plants. Plants grow at a given rate, but they do not move. Some creatures eat\\nplants. They will die if they do not ﬁnd their food plant.\\n• Simulate weather. Weather can change, and it inﬂuences the behaviour of some simulated\\naspects. For example, grass may not grow without rain, or predators cannot see well in fog.\\n• Simulate disease. Some animals are occasionally infected.

Note that this is slightly diﬀerent from the book project,\\nso please use the version from KEATS, not from the book projects.\\nYou must replace the Fox and Rabbit classes with diﬀerent kinds of predator and prey to simulate\\na diﬀerent habitat (for example, under water, in a jungle, or in a fantasy world). You may add\\nadditional classes to those included in the existing project.\\nThis project is a pair programming task. You must work in pairs.
