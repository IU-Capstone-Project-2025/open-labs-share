      "student has completed all of the base tasks including following submission instructions (e.g.,\n",
      "the student submitted a Jar ﬁle of their BlueJ project).\n",
      "2. Code Elegance —The application is written in such a way that the code is reusable and\n",
      "eﬃcient (i.e., memory usage and complexity). The application appropriately uses loops\n",
      "and functions to reduce code complexity and/or repeated code. The application does not\n",
      "have hard-coded solutions or poorly designed solutions. A poorly designed solution is overly\n",
      "complicated, utilises excessive amounts of memory or utilises a slower approach to a problem.\n",
      "3. Documentation —The application is suﬃciently documented. Good documentation/comments\n",
      "should explain what the code does and how it does it. Comments can also be used to highlight\n",
      "nuances in your solution, e.g., a segment of code that only works under certain conditions.\n",

      "### Assignment Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "**Objective:** To extend a predator-prey simulation and modify it to include additional features and behaviors. You will need to create and implement new classes for different types of animals, modify existing classes, and enhance the simulation logic.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Submission Components:**\n",
      "- **Code Submission:** A JAR file containing the updated Java source code.\n",
      "- **Report Submission:** A PDF report detailing your simulation, including descriptions of the simulation types, extensions, and documentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Points to Consider\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Simulation Types:** Replace the `Fox` and `Rabbit` classes with different types of predators and prey to simulate various habitats like underwater, in a jungle, or in a fantasy world.\n",
      "2. **Extension Tasks:** Add additional classes to the existing project, such as birds, snakes, or insects.\n",
      "3. **Documentation:** Ensure that your code is well-documented, explaining the purpose and functionality of each method and class.\n",
      "4. **Readability:** Maintain good programming practices and ensure the code is easy to understand and maintain.\n",
      "5. **Pair Programming:** Work in pairs according to the guidelines provided on KEATS.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Submission Guidelines\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Code Submission:** Submit your JAR file to the \"Assignment 3: Code Submission\" link on KEATS before the deadline.\n",
      "- **Report Submission:** Submit your PDF report to the \"Assignment 3: Report Submission\" link on KEATS before the deadline.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Marking Criteria\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Program Correctness:** The application meets all of the program specifications, including following submission instructions.\n",
      "- **Code Elegance:** The application is written in such a way that the code is reusable and efficient (e.g., memory usage and complexity). The application appropriately uses loops and functions to reduce code complexity and/or repeated code. The application does not have hard-coded solutions or poorly designed solutions.\n",
      "- **Documentation:** The application is suﬃciently documented. Good documentation/comments should explain what the code does and how it does it. Comments can also be used to highlight nuances in your solution, e.g., a segment of code that only works under certain conditions.\n",
      "- **Readability:** The application is easy to understand and uses good programming practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Details\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Deadline:** After submitting your work on KEATS, check that (1) your JAR file and report (PDF) has been successfully uploaded and (2) that the JAR file contains all of your source files. This assignment is due Wednesday, March 2nd, 23:59.\n",
      "- **Marking:** Applications are marked based on four categories:\n",
      "  - **Program Correctness:** The application meets all of the program speciﬁcations, i.e., the student has completed all of the base tasks including following submission instructions (e.g., the student submitted a Jar ﬁle of their BlueJ project).\n",
      "  - **Code Elegance:** The application is written in such a way that the code is reusable and efficient (e.g., memory usage and complexity). The application appropriately uses loops and functions to reduce code complexity and/or repeated code. The application does not have hard-coded solutions or poorly designed solutions.\n",
      "  - **Documentation:** The application is suﬃciently documented. Good documentation/comments should explain what the code does and how it does it. Comments can also be used to highlight nuances in your solution, e.g., a segment of code that only works under certain conditions.\n",

At least two of\\nthese should be predators (they eat another species), and at least two of them should not be\\npredators (they may eat plants). You can either treat plants as if they’re always available\\nor simulate their growth/death (see challenge task).\\n• At least two predators should compete for the same food source.\\n• Some or all of the species should distinguish male and female individuals. For these, the\\ncreatures can only propagate when a male and female individual meet. Meet means they\\nneed to be within a speciﬁed distance to each other, for example in a neighbouring cell.\\nYou will need to experiment with the parameters for breeding probability to create a stable\\npopulation.\\n• You should keep track of the time of day. At least some creatures should exhibit diﬀerent\\nbehaviour at some time of the day (for example: they may sleep at night and not move\\naround during that time).\\nYou should implement the base tasks ﬁrst before you move on to the Challenge tasks.\\n4 Challenge Tasks\\nOnce you have ﬁnished the base tasks, implement one or more challenge tasks. You can either\\nchoose from the following suggestions, or invent your own. You will be graded on a maximum of\\nfour challenge tasks.\\n• Simulate plants. Plants grow at a given rate, but they do not move. Some creatures eat\\nplants. They will die if they do not ﬁnd their food plant.\\n• Simulate weather. Weather can change, and it inﬂuences the behaviour of some simulated\\naspects. For example, grass may not grow without rain, or predators cannot see well in fog.\\n• Simulate disease. Some animals are occasionally infected. Infection can spread to other\\nanimals when they meet.\\n2\\n\\n\\nimport java.util.List;\\n\\n/**\\n * A class representing shared characteristics of animals.\\n *\\n * @version 2016.02.29 (2)\\n */\\npublic abstract class Animal\\n{\\n    // Whether the animal is alive or not.\\n    private boolean alive;\\n    // The animal\\'s field.\\n    private Field field;\\n    // The animal\\'s position in the field.\\n    private Location location;\\n    \\n    /**\\n     * Create a new animal at location in field.\\n     * \\n     * @param field The field currently occupied.\\n     * @param location The location within the field.\\n     */\\n    public Animal(Field field, Location location)\\n    {\\n        alive = true;\\n        this.field = field;\\n        setLocation(location);\\n    }\\n    \\n    /**\\n     * Make this animal act - that is: make it do\\n     * whatever it wants/needs to do.\\n     * @param newAnimals A list to receive newly born animals.\\n     */\\n    abstract public void act(List<Animal> newAnimals);\\n\\n    /**\\n     * Check whether the animal is alive or not.\\n     * @return true if the animal is still alive.\\n     */\\n    protected boolean isAlive()\\n    {\\n        return alive;\\n    }\\n\\n    /**\\n     * Indicate that the animal is no longer alive.\\n     * It is removed from the field.\\n     */\\n    protected void setDead()\\n    {\\n        alive = false;\\n        if(location != null) {\\n            field.clear(location);\\n            location = null;\\n            field = null;\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    /**\\n     * Return the animal\\'s location.\\n     * @return The animal\\'s location.\\n     */\\n    protected Location getLocation()\\n    {\\n        return location;\\n    }\\n    \\n    /**\\n     * Place the animal at the new location in the given field.\\n     * @param newLocation The animal\\'s new location.\\n     */\\n    protected void setLocation(Location newLocation)\\n    {\\n        if(location != null) {\\n            field.clear(location);\\n        }\\n        location = newLocation;\\n        field.place(this, newLocation);\\n    }\\n    \\n    /**\\n     * Return the animal\\'s field.\\n     * @return The animal\\'s field.\\n     */\\n    protected Field getField()\\n    {\\n        return field;\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n\\n4CCS1PPA Programming Practice and Applications\\nCoursework 3: Predator/Prey Simulation\\nMichael K¨ olling and Jeﬀery Raphael\\nQuestions? programming@kcl.ac.uk\\nYour task is to extend a predator/prey simulation.
