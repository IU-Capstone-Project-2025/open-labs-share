## Kanban Board Workflow

We use a GitHub Project Kanban board to track issues and development progress. The board automatically manages issue status based on your development workflow.

### Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Create or Pick an Issue**
   - Create a new issue or pick one from the Backlog column
   - Issue automatically appears in **Backlog**

2. **Create a Branch**
   - Check `Development` tab in thhe issue itself, and click on `Create a branch for this issue or link a pull request`
   - Branch source must be dev
   - Click on `Create branch`
   - Insert suggested commands to the terminal
   - Branch will be created and issue will be moved to **In Progress**

3. **Work on Your Changes**
   - Make your commits following the commit guidelines below
   - Push changes to your branch

4. **Create Pull Request**
   - Create PR from your branch to `dev`
   - Issue automatically moves to **In Review**
   - Get code reviews as required

5. **Merge Pull Request**
   - Once approved, merge the PR
   - Issue automatically moves to **Done** and gets closed
   - Delete the branch after merging

### How the Kanban Automation Works

**ðŸ“‹ Issue Lifecycle:**
1. **Create Issue** â†’ Issue automatically moves to **Backlog**
2. **Create Branch** (with issue number) â†’ Issue automatically moves to **In Progress** 
3. **Create Pull Request** â†’ Issue automatically moves to **In Review**
4. **Merge Pull Request** â†’ Issue automatically moves to **Done** and gets closed


### Manual Status Updates

If needed, you can manually move issues between columns in the [Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/IU-Capstone-Project-2025/projects/6), but the automation should handle most cases.

## Development Process

1. **Branch Management**
   - Style: start with lower case, connect with dashes (example: `kebab-case-example)
   - Main branch: `main`. Do not commit here, only PR's are accepted
   - Development branch: `dev`. Create your branches from here
   - Feature branches: `(num-of-issue)-(short-description)` (example: `09-fix-allignment`) and must be created from branch `dev`

2. **Commit Guidelines**
   - Use clear and descriptive commit messages
   - Follow the format: `type(scope): description`
   - Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore

3. **Pull Request Process**
   - Create PRs against the `dev` branch
   - PR name is the same as the issue from which working branch was created
   - PR description is AC from the issue
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Update documentation as needed
   - Get at least two reviews before merging
   - Use merge and rebase (preferable) or default merge
   - If working branch is made from numbered issue, then delete the branch after merging into `dev`

## Code Style

- Follow the existing code style
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused

## Documentation

- Update README.md in working folder (not in the core folder) when adding new features
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes

## Security

- Never commit sensitive information
- Follow security best practices

## Commit Message Guidelines

### Commit Message Format

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**.  The header has a special
format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
```

The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional (read below).

Examples of correct commit message:

*More preferable:*

```
docs(changelog): update changelog to beta.5
```

*Acceptable:*

```
fix(release): need to depend on latest rxjs and zone.js

The version in our package.json gets copied to the one we publish, and users need the latest of these.
```

### Type

Must be one of the following:

- **deploy**: Changes that affect deploy of the system or additional services
- **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **feat**: A new feature
- **update**: Updating already introduced feature *(**scope** is mandatory)*
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

### Scope

The following is the current list of supported scopes (may be updated later or you can use logic here):

- **api**
- **users**
- **karma**
- **labs**
- **papers**
- **feedback**
- **questionary**
- **storage**
- **ml**
- **frontend**
- **docker**
- **k8s**

There are currently only one exception to the "use package name" rule:
- none/empty string: useful for `style`, `test` and `refactor` changes that are done across all packages (correct e.g. `style: add missing semicolons`)

### Subject

The subject contains a succinct description of the change:

- use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- don't capitalize the first letter
- no dot (.) at the end

### Body

It is optional. Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

### Revert

If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert:`, followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.
